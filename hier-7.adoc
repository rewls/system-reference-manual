== Description

* A typical Linux system has, among others, the following directories:

[.underline]#/#::
* This is the root directory.
* This is where the whole tree starts.

[.underline]#/bin#::
* This directory contains executable programs which are needed in single user
  mode and to bring the system up or repair it.

[.underline]#/boot#::
* Contains static files for the boot loader.
* This directory holds only the files which are needed during the boot
  process.
* The map installer and configuration files should go to
  [.underline]#/sbin# and [.underline]#/etc#.
* The operating system kernel (initrd for example) must be located in either
  [.underline]#/# or [.underline]#/boot#.

[.underline]#/dev#::
* Special or device files, which refer to physical devices.
* See *mknod*(1).

[.underline]#/etc#::
* Contains configuration files which are local to the machine.
* Some larger software packages, like X11, can have their own subdirectories
  below [.underline]#/etc#.
* Site-wide configuration files may be placed here or in
  [.underline]#/usr/etc#.
* Nevertheless, programs should always look for these files in
  [.underline]#/etc# and you may have links for these files to
  [.underline]#/usr/etc#.

[.underline]#/etc/skel#::
* When a new user account is created, files from this directory are usually
  copied into the user's home directory.

[.underline]#/home#::
* On machines with home directories for users, these are usually beneath this directory, directly or not.
* The structure of this directory depends on local administration decisions
  (optional).

[.underline]#/lib#::
* This directory should hold those shared libraries that are necessary to boot
  the system and to run the commands in the root filesystem.

[.underline]#/lib/modules#::
* Loadable kernel modules (optional).

[.underline]#/lost+found#::
* This directory contains items lost in the filesystem.
* These items are usually chunks of files mangled as a consequence of a faulty
  disk or a system crash.

[.underline]#/media#::
* This directory contains mount points for removable media such as CD and DVD
  disks or USB sticks.

[.underline]#/mnt#::
* This directory is a mount point for a temporarily mounted filesystem.
* In some distributions, [.underline]#/mnt# contains subdirectories intended
  to be used as mount points for several temporary filesystems.

[.underline]#/opt#::
* This directory should contain add-on packages that contain static files.

[.underline]#/proc#::
* This is a mount point for the [.underline]#proc# filesystem, which provides
  information about running processes and the kernel.
* This pseudo-filesystem is described in more detail in *proc*(5).

[.underline]#/root#::
* This directory is usually the home directory for the root user (optional).

[.underline]#/run#::
* This directory contains information which describes the system since it was
  booted.

[.underline]#/sbin#::
* Like [.underline]#/bin#, this directory holds commands needed to boot the
  system, but which are usually not executed by normal users.

[.underline]#/srv#::
* This directory contains site-specific data that is served by this system.

[.underline]#/sys#::
* This is a mount point for the sysfs filesystem, which provides information
  about the kernel like [.underline]#/proc#, but better structured, following
  the formalism of kobject infrastructure.

[.underline]#/tmp#::
* This directory contains temporary files which may be deleted with no notice,
  such as by a regular job or at system boot up.

[.underline]#/usr#::
* This directory is usually mounted from a separate partition.
* It should hold only shareable, read-only data, so that it can be mounted by
  various machines running Linux.

[.underline]#/usr/bin#::
* This is the primary directory for executable programs.
* Most programs executed by normal users which are not needed for booting or
  for repairing the system and which are not installed locally should be
  placed in this directory.

[.underline]#/usr/include#::
* Include files for the C compiler.

[.underline]#/usr/local#::
* This is where programs which are local to the site typically go.

[.underline]#/usr/local/bin#::
* Binaries for programs local to the site.

[.underline]#/usr/local/sbin#::
* Locally installed programs for system administration.

[.underline]#/var#::
* This directory contains files which may change in size, such as spool and
  log files.

[.underline]#/var/log#::
* Miscellaneous log files.

[.underline]#/var/spool#::
* Spooled (or queued) files for various programs.

[.underline]#/var/spool/cron#::
* Spooled jobs for *cron*(8).
