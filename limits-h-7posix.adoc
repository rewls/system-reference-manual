= limits.h(7POSIX)

== Name

* limits.h -- implementation-defined constants

== Synopsis

[source,c]
#include <limits.h>

== Description

* Some of the functionality described on this reference page extends the ISO C
  standard.
* Applications shall define the appropriate feature test macro (see the System
  Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017, [.underline]#Section 2.2, The Compilation
  Environment#)
  to enable the visibility of these symbols in this header.

'''

* Many of the symbols listed here are not defined by the ISO/IEC 9899:1999
  standard.
* Such symbols are not shown as CX shaded, except under the heading Numerical
  Limits.

'''

* The [.underline]#<limits.h># header shall define macros and symbolic
  constants for various limits.
* Different categories of limits are described below, representing various
  limits on resources that the implementation imposes on applications.
* All macros and symbolic constants defined in this header shall be suitable
  for use in *#if* preprocessing directives.

'''

* Implementations may choose any appropriate value for each limit, provided it
  is not more restrictive than the Minimum Acceptable Values listed below.
* Symbolic constant names beginning with _POSIX may be found in
  [.underline]#<unistd.h>#.

'''

* Applications should not assume any particular value for a limit.
* To achieve maximum portability, an application should not require more
  resource than the Minimum Acceptable Value quantity.
* However, an application wishing to avail itself of the full amount of a
  resource available on an implementation may make use of the value given in
  [.underlin]#<limits.h># on that particular implementation, by using the macros and
  symbolic constants listed below.
* It should be noted, however, that many of the listed limits are not
  invariant, and at runtime, the value of the limit may differ from those
  given in this header, for the following reasons:
** The limit is pathname-dependent.
** The limit differs between the compile and runtime machines.

* For these reasons, an application may use the [.underline]#fpathconf#(),
  [.underline]#pathconf#(), and [.underline]#sysconf#() functions to determine
  the actual value of a limit at runtime.

'''

* The items in the list ending in _MIN give the most negative values that the
  mathematical types are guaranteed to be capable of representing.
* Numbers of a more negative value may be supported on some implementations,
  as indicated by the [.underline]#<limits.h># header on the implementation,
  but applications  requiring such numbers are not guaranteed to be portable
  to all implementations.
* For positive constants ending in _MIN, this indicates the minimum acceptable
  value.

=== Runtime Invariant Values (Possibly Indeterminate)

* A definition of one of the symbolic constants in the following list shall be
  omitted from [.underline]#<limits.h># on specific implementations where the
  corresponding value is equal to or greater than the stated minimum, but is
  unspecified.

'''

* This indetermination might depend on the amount of available memory space on
  a specific instance of a specific implementation.
* The actual value supported by a specific instance shall be provided by the
  `sysconf()` function.

'''

{OPEN_MAX}::
* A value one greater than the maximum value that the system may assign to a
  newly-created file descriptor.
* Minimum Acceptable Value: {_POSIX_OPEN_MAX}

=== Minimum Values

* The [.underline]#<limits.h># header shall define the following symbolic
  constants with the values shown.
* These are the most restrictive values for certain features on an
  implementation conforming to this volume of POSIX.1‐2017.
* Related symbolic constants are defined elsewhere in this volume of
  POSIX.1‐2017 which reflect the actual implementation and which need not be
  as restrictive.
* For each of these limits, a conforming implementation shall provide a value
  at least this large or shall have no limit.
* A strictly conforming application must not require a larger value for
  correct operation.

'''

{_POSIX_OPEN_MAX}::
* A value one greater than the maximum value that the system may assign to a
  newly-created file descriptor.
* Value: 20
