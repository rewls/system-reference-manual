== Description

* *adduser* and *addgroup* add users and groups to the system according to
  command line options and configuration information in
  [.underline]#/etc/adduser.conf#.
* They are friendlier front ends to the low level tools like *useradd*,
  *groupadd* and *usermod* programs, by default choosing Debian policy
  conformant UID and GID values, creating a home directory with skeletal
  configuration, running a custom script, and other features.

'''

* *adduser* and *addgroup* are intended as a policy layer, making it easier
  for package maintainers and local administrators to create local system
  accounts in the way Debian expects them to  be created,  taking the burden
  to adapt to the probably changing specifications of Debian policy.

'''

* adduser* honors the distinction between [.underline]#dynamically allocated
  system users and groups# and [.underline]#dynamically allocated user
  accounts# that is documented in Debian Policy, Chapter 9.2.2.

'''

* For a full list and explanations of all options, see the OPTIONS section.

'''

* *adduser* and *addgroup* can be run in one of five modes:

=== Add a normal user

* If called with one non-option argument and without the *--system* or
  *--group*  options, *adduser* will add a normal user, that means a
  [.underline]#dynamically allocated user account# in the sense of Debian
  Policy.
* This is commonly referred to in *adduser* as a [.underline]#non-system
  user#.

'''

* By default, each user is given a corresponding group with the same name.
* This is commonly called [.underline]#Usergroups# and allows group writable
  directories to be easily maintained by placing the appropriate users in the
  new group, setting the set-group-ID bit in the directory, and ensuring that
  all users use a umask of 002.

'''

* *adduser* will copy files from [.underline]#/etc/skel# into the home
  directory and prompt for the comment field and a password if those functions
  have not been turned off / overridden from the command line.

=== Add a group

* If *adduser* is called with the *--group* option and without the *--system*
  option, or *addgroup* is called respectively, a user group will be added.

'''

* The group is created with no members.

=== Add an existing user to an existing group

* If called with two non-option arguments, *adduser* will add an existing user
  to an existing group.

* Debian GNU/Linux
