* File Formats Manual

== Name

* sysfs - a filesystem for exporting kernel objects

== Description

* The *sysfs* filesystem is a pseudo-filesystem which provides an interface to
  kernel data structures.
* (More precisely, the files and directories in *sysfs* provide a view of the
  [.underline]#kobject# structures defined internally within the kernel.)
* The files under *sysfs* provide information about devices, kernel modules,
  filesystems, and other kernel components.

'''

* The *sysfs* filesystem is commonly mounted at [.underline]#/sys#.
* Typically, it is mounted automatically by the system, but it can also be
  mounted manually using a command such as:
+
....
mount -t sysfs sysfs /sys
....

* Many of the files in the *sysfs* filesystem are read-only, but some files
  are writable, allowing kernel variables to be changed.
* To avoid redundancy, symbolic links are heavily used to connect entries
  across the file system tree.

=== Files and directories

* The following list describes some of the files and directories under the
  [.underline]#/sys# hierarchy.

'''

[.underline]#/sys/bus##::
* This directory contains one subdirectory for each of the bus types in the
  kernel.
* Inside each of these directories are two subdirectories:
[.underline]#devices#:::
** This subdirectory contains symbolic links to entries in
  [.underline]#/sys/devices# that correspond to the devices discovered on this
  bus.

[.underline]#/sys/class#::
* This subdirectory contains a single layer of further subdirectories for each
  of the device classes that have been registered on the system (e.g.,
  terminals, network devices, block devices, graphics devices, sound devices,
  and so on).
* Inside each of these subdirectories are symbolic links for each of the
  devices in this class.
* These symbolic links refer to entries in the [.underline]#/sys/devices#
  directory.

[.underline]#/sys/dev#::
* This directory contains two subdirectories [.underline]#block/# and
  [.underline]#char/#, corresponding, respectively, to the block and character devices on the system.
* Inside each of these subdirectories are symbolic links with names of the
  form [.underline]#major-ID#:[.underline]#minor-ID#, where the ID values correspond to the major and
  minor ID of a specific device.
* Each symbolic link points to the sysfs directory for a device.
* The symbolic links inside [.underline]#/sys/dev# thus provide an easy way to
  look up the *sysfs* interface using the device IDs returned by a call to
  *stat*(2) (or similar).

[.underline]#/sys/devices#::
* This is a directory that contains a filesystem representation of the kernel
  device tree, which is a hierarchy of device structures within the kernel.

[.underline]#/sys/firmware#::
* This subdirectory contains interfaces for viewing and manipulating
  firmware-specific objects and attributes.

[.underline]#/sys/kernel#::
* This subdirectory contains various files and subdirectories that provide
  information about the running kernel.

[.underline]#/sys/module#::
* This subdirectory contains one subdirectory for each module that is loaded
  into the kernel.
* The name of each directory is the name of the module.
* In each of the subdirectories, there may be following subdirectories:

'''

[.underline]#parameters#::
* This directory contains one file for each module parameter, with each file
  containing the value of the corresponding parameter.

== Standards

* The *sysfs* filesystem is Linux-specific.

== Notes

* This manual page is incomplete, possibly inaccurate, and is the kind of
  thing that needs to be updated very often.
