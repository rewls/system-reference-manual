== NAME

* systemd-journald.service, systemd-journald.socket,
  systemd-journald-dev-log.socket, systemd-journald-audit.socket,
  systemd-journald@.service, systemd-journald@.socket,
  systemd-journald-varlink@.socket, systemd-journald - Journal service

== Description

* systemd-journald is a system service that collects and stores logging data.
* It creates and maintains structured, indexed journals based on logging
  information that is received from a variety of sources:
** Kernel log messages, via kmsg
** Simple system log messages, via the libc *syslog*(3) call
** Structured system log messages via the native Journal API, see
   *sd_journal_print*(3) and *Native Journal Protocol*[1]
** Standard output and standard error of service units. +
   For further details see below.
** Audit records, originating from the kernel audit subsystem

* The daemon will implicitly collect numerous metadata fields for each log
  messages in a secure and unfakeable way.
* See *systemd.journal-fields*(7) for more information about the collected
  metadata.

'''

* Log data collected by the journal is primarily text-based but can also
  include binary data where necessary.
* Individual fields making up a log record stored in the journal may be up to
  2-1 bytes in size.

'''

* The journal service stores log data either persistently below
  /var/log/journal or in a volatile way below /run/log/journal/ (in the latter
  case it is lost at reboot).
* By default, log data is stored persistently if /var/log/journal/ exists
  during boot, with an implicit fallback to volatile storage otherwise.
* Use [.underline]#Storage=# in *journald.conf*(5) to configure where log data
  is placed, independently of the existence of /var/log/journal/.

'''

* Note that journald will initially use volatile storage, until a call to
  *journalctl --flush* (or sending SIGUSR1 to journald) will cause it to
  switch to persistent logging (under the conditions mentioned above).
* This is done automatically on boot via "systemd-journal-flush.service".

'''

* On systems where /var/log/journal/ does not exist yet but where persistent
  logging is desired (and the default journald.conf is used), it is sufficient
  to create the directory, and ensure it has the correct access modes and
  ownership:
+
....
mkdir -p /var/log/journal
systemd-tmpfiles --create --prefix /var/log/journal
....

* See *journald.conf*(5) for information about the configuration of this
  service.
