== Description

* The address is a protocol (IPv4 or IPv6) address attached to a network
  device.
* Each device must have at least one address to use the corresponding
  protocol.
* It is possible to have several different addresses attached to one device.
* These addresses are not discriminated, so that the term *alias* is not quite
  appropriate for them and we do not use it in this document.

'''

* The *ip address* command displays addresses and their properties, adds new
  addresses and deletes old ones.

'''

`*ip address show*`::
* look at protocol addresses
`*dev* [.underline]#IFNAME#` (default)::
* name of device.
