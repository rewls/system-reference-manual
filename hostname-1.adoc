= HOSTNAME(1)

* Linux Programmer's Manual

== Name

* hostname - show or set the system's host name

== Synopsis

[subs="attributes,quotes+"]
....
*hostname [-b|--boot] [-F|--file filename] [hostname]*
....

== Description

* Hostname is used to display the system's DNS name, and to display or set its
  hostname or NIS domain name.

=== Get name

* When called without any arguments, the program displays the current names:
** *hostname* will print the name of the system as returned by the
   gethostname(2) function.

=== Set name

* When called with one argument or with the *--file* option, the commands set
  the host name or the NIS/YP domain name.
* *hostname* uses the *sethostname*(2) function.
* Note, that this is effective only until the next reboot.
* Edit /etc/hostname for permanent change.

'''

* Note, that only the super-user can change the names.

'''

* The host name is usually set once at system startup in
  [.underline]#/etc/init.d/hostname.sh# (normally by reading the contents of a
  file which contains the host name, e.g. [.underline]#/etc/hostname#).
