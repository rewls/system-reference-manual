= HOSTNAME(1)

* Linux Programmer's Manual

== Name

* hostname - show or set the system's host name

== Synopsis

[subs="attributes,quotes+"]
....
*hostname [-b|--boot] [-F|--file filename] [hostname]*
....

== Description

* Hostname is used to display the system's DNS name, and to display or set its
  hostname or NIS domain name.

=== Get name

* When called without any arguments, the program displays the current names:
** *hostname* will print the name of the system as returned by the
   gethostname(2) function.

=== Set name

* When called with one argument or with the *--file* option, the commands set
  the host name or the NIS/YP domain name.
* *hostname* uses the *sethostname*(2) function.
* Note, that this is effective only until the next reboot.
* Edit /etc/hostname for permanent change.

'''

* Note, that only the super-user can change the names.

'''

* The host name is usually set once at system startup in
  [.underline]#/etc/init.d/hostname.sh# (normally by reading the contents of a
  file which contains the host name, e.g. [.underline]#/etc/hostname#).

=== The fqdn

* The FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) of the system is the name that the
  *resolver*(3) returns for the host name, such as,
  [.underline]#ursula.example.com#.
* It is usually the hostname followed by the DNS domain name (the part after the first dot).
* You can check the FQDN using *hostname --fqdn* or the domain name using
  *dnsdomainname*.

'''

* You cannot change the FQDN with *hostname* or *dnsdomainname*.

'''

* The recommended method of setting the FQDN is to make the hostname be an
  alias for the fully qualified name using [.underline]#/etc/hosts#, DNS, or
  NIS.
* For example, if the hostname was "ursula", one might have a line in
  [.underline]#/etc/hosts# which reads
+
....
127.0.1.1    ursula.example.com ursula
....

* Technically: The FQDN is the name *getaddrinfo*(3) returns for the host name
  returned by *gethostname*(2).
* The DNS domain name is the part after the first dot.

'''

* Therefore it depends on the configuration of the resolver (usually in
  [.underline]#/etc/host.conf#) how you can change it.
* Usually the hosts file is parsed before DNS or NIS, so it is most common to
  change the FQDN in [.underline]#/etc/hosts#.

'''

* If a machine has multiple network interfaces/addresses or is used in a
  mobile environment, then it may either have multiple FQDNs/domain names or
  none at all.
* Therefore avoid using *hostname --fqdn*, *hostname --domain* and
  *dnsdomainname*.
* *hostname --ip-address* is subject to the same limitations so it should be
  avoided as well.

== Files

/etc/hostname::
* Historically this file was supposed to only contain the hostname and not the
  full canonical FQDN.
* Nowadays most software is able to cope with a full FQDN here.
* This file is read at boot time by the system initialization scripts to set
  the hostname.

/etc/hosts::
* Usually, this is where one sets the domain name by aliasing the host name to
  the FQDN.
