.PP
Only the most useful options are listed here; see below for the
remainder.  \fBg++\fR accepts mostly the same options as \fBgcc\fR.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"

.IP \[bu] 3
When you invoke GCC, it normally does preprocessing, compilation,
assembly and linking.
.IP \[bu]
The "overall options" allow you to stop this
process at an intermediate stage.
.IP \[bu]
For example, the \fB\-c\fR option
says not to run the linker.
.IP \[bu]
Then the output consists of object files
output by the assembler.
.PP
-
.IP \[bu] 3
Other options are passed on to one or more stages of processing.
.IP \[bu]
Some options
control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself.
.IP \[bu]
Yet other
options control the assembler and linker; most of these are not
documented here, since you rarely need to use any of them.
.PP
-
.IP \[bu] 3
Most of the command-line options that you can use with GCC are useful
for C programs; when an option is only useful with another language
(usually C++), the explanation says so explicitly.
.IP \[bu]
If the description
for a particular option does not mention a source language, you can use
that option with all supported languages.
.PP
-
.IP \[bu] 3
The usual way to run GCC is to run the executable called \fBgcc\fR, or
\&\fImachine\fR\fB\-gcc\fR when cross-compiling, or
\&\fImachine\fR\fB\-gcc\-\fR\fIversion\fR to run a specific version of GCC.
.IP \[bu]
When you compile C++ programs, you should invoke GCC as \fBg++\fR
instead.
.PP
-
.IP \[bu] 3
The \fBgcc\fR program accepts options and file names as operands.
.IP \[bu]
Many
options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letter options
may \fInot\fR be grouped: \fB\-dv\fR is very different from \fB\-d\ \-v\fR.
.PP
-
.IP \[bu] 3
You can mix options and other arguments.
.IP \[bu]
For the most part, the order
you use doesn't matter.
.IP \[bu]
Order does matter when you use several
options of the same kind; for example, if you specify \fB\-L\fR more
than once, the directories are searched in the order specified.
.IP \[bu]
Also,
the placement of the \fB\-l\fR option is significant.
.PP
-
.IP \[bu] 3
Many options have long names starting with \fB\-f\fR or with
\&\fB\-W\fR\-\-\-for example,
\&\fB\-fmove\-loop\-invariants\fR, \fB\-Wformat\fR and so on.
.IP \[bu]
Most of
these have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of
\&\fB\-ffoo\fR is \fB\-fno\-foo\fR.
.IP \[bu]
This manual documents
only one of these two forms, whichever one is not the default.
.PP
-
.IP \[bu] 3
Some options take one or more arguments typically separated either
by a space or by the equals sign (\fB=\fR) from the option name.
.IP \[bu]
Unless documented otherwise, an argument can be either numeric or
a string.
.IP \[bu]
Numeric arguments must typically be small unsigned decimal
or hexadecimal integers.
.IP \[bu]
Hexadecimal arguments must begin with
the \fB0x\fR prefix.
.IP \[bu]
Arguments to options that specify a size
threshold of some sort may be arbitrarily large decimal or hexadecimal
integers followed by a byte size suffix designating a multiple of bytes
such as \f(CW\*(C`kB\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`KiB\*(C'\fR for kilobyte and kibibyte, respectively,
\&\f(CW\*(C`MB\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`MiB\*(C'\fR for megabyte and mebibyte, \f(CW\*(C`GB\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`GiB\*(C'\fR for gigabyte and gigibyte, and so on.
.IP \[bu]
Such arguments are
designated by \fIbyte-size\fR in the following text.
.IP \[bu]
Refer to the NIST,
IEC, and other relevant national and international standards for the full
listing and explanation of the binary and decimal byte size prefixes.

.SH OPTIONS
.IX Header "OPTIONS"

.SS "Options Controlling the Preprocessor"
.IX Subsection "Options Controlling the Preprocessor"

.IP \[bu] 3
These options control the C preprocessor, which is run on each C source
file before actual compilation.
.PP
-
.IP \[bu] 3
If you use the \fB\-E\fR option, nothing is done except preprocessing.
.IP \[bu]
Some of these options make sense only together with \fB\-E\fR because
they cause the preprocessor output to be unsuitable for actual
compilation.
.PP
-
.IP \[bu] 3
In addition to the options listed here, there are a number of options
to control search paths for include files documented in
\&\fBDirectory Options\fR.
.IP \[bu]
Options to control preprocessor diagnostics are listed in
\&\fBWarning Options\fR.

.IP \fB\-M\fR 4
.IX Item "-M"
.RS
.IP \[bu] 3
Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a rule
suitable for \fBmake\fR describing the dependencies of the main
source file.
.IP \[bu]
The preprocessor outputs one \fBmake\fR rule containing
the object file name for that source file, a colon, and the names of all
the included files, including those coming from \fB\-include\fR or
\&\fB\-imacros\fR command-line options.
.P
-
.IP \[bu] 3
Unless specified explicitly (with \fB\-MT\fR or \fB\-MQ\fR), the
object file name consists of the name of the source file with any
suffix replaced with object file suffix and with any leading directory
parts removed.
.IP \[bu]
If there are many included files then the rule is
split into several lines using \fB\e\fR\-newline.
.IP \[bu]
The rule has no
commands.
.P
-
.IP \[bu] 3
This option does not suppress the preprocessor's debug output, such as
\&\fB\-dM\fR.
.IP \[bu]
To avoid mixing such debug output with the dependency
rules you should explicitly specify the dependency output file with
\&\fB\-MF\fR, or use an environment variable like
\&\fBDEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT\fR.
.IP \[bu] 3
Debug output
is still sent to the regular output stream as normal.
.P
-
.IP \[bu] 3
Passing \fB\-M\fR to the driver implies \fB\-E\fR, and suppresses
warnings with an implicit \fB\-w\fR.
.RE

.IP \fB\-MM\fR 4
.IX Item "-MM"
.RS
.IP \[bu] 3
Like \fB\-M\fR but do not mention header files that are found in
system header directories, nor header files that are included,
directly or indirectly, from such a header.
.P
-
.IP \[bu] 3
This implies that the choice of angle brackets or double quotes in an
\&\fB#include\fR directive does not in itself determine whether that
header appears in \fB\-MM\fR dependency output.
.RE

.IP "\fB\-MF\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MF file"
.RS
.IP \[bu] 3
When used with \fB\-M\fR or \fB\-MM\fR, specifies a
file to write the dependencies to.
.IP \[bu]
If no \fB\-MF\fR switch is given
the preprocessor sends the rules to the same place it would send
preprocessed output.
.P
-
.IP \[bu] 3
When used with the driver options \fB\-MD\fR or \fB\-MMD\fR,
\&\fB\-MF\fR overrides the default dependency output file.
.P
-
.IP \[bu]
If \fIfile\fR is \fI\-\fR, then the dependencies are written to \fIstdout\fR.
.RE

.IP "\fB\-MT\fR \fItarget\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MT target"
.RS
.IP \[bu] 3
Change the target of the rule emitted by dependency generation.
.IP \[bu]
By
default CPP takes the name of the main input file, deletes any
directory components and any file suffix such as \fB.c\fR, and
appends the platform's usual object suffix.
.IP \[bu]
The result is the target.
.P
-
.IP \[bu] 3
An \fB\-MT\fR option sets the target to be exactly the string you
specify.
.IP \[bu]
If you want multiple targets, you can specify them as a single
argument to \fB\-MT\fR, or use multiple \fB\-MT\fR options.
.P
-
.IP \[bu] 3
For example, \fB\-MT\ '$(objpfx)foo.o'\fR might give
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        $(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c
