# SED(1)

## NAME

- stream editor for filtering and transforming text

## DESCRIPTION

- A stream editor is used to perform basic text transformations on an input stream.

- sed works by making only one pass over the input(s), and is consequently more efficient.

## COMMAND SYNOPSIS

- This is just a brief synopsis of sed commands to serve as a reminder to those who already know sed; other documentation (such as the texinfo document) must be consulted for fuller descriptions.

## SEE ALSO

- The full documentation for sed is maintained as a Texinfo manual.

- If the info and sed programs are properly installed at your site, the command `info sed` should give you access to the complete manual.
