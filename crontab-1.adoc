= CRONTAB(1)

* General Commands Manual

== Name

* crontab - maintain crontab files for individual users (Vixie Cron)

== Description

* [.underline]#crontab# is the program used to install, deinstall or list the
  tables used to drive the cron(8) daemon in Vixie Cron.
* Each user can have their own crontab, and though these are files in
  /var/spool/cron/crontabs, they are not intended to be edited directly.

'''

* If the [.underline]#/etc/cron.allow# file exists, then you must be listed
  (one user per line) therein in order to be allowed to use this command.
* If the [.underline]#/etc/cron.allow# file does not exist but the
  [.underline]#/etc/cron.deny# file does exist, then you must not be listed in
  the [.underline]#/etc/cron.deny# file in order to use this command.

'''

* If neither of these files exists, then depending on site-dependent
  configuration  parameters, only the super user will be allowed to use this
  command, or all users will be able to use this command.

'''

* If both files exist then [.underline]#/etc/cron.allow# takes precedence.
* Which means that [.underline]#/etc/cron.deny# is not considered and your
  user must be listed in [.underline]#/etc/cron.allow# in order to be able to
  use the crontab.

'''

* Regardless of the existence of any of these files, the root administrative
  user is always  allowed to setup a crontab.
* For standard Debian systems, all users may use this command.

'''

* The first form of this command is used to install a new crontab from some
  named file or standard input if the pseudo-filename '-' is given.
