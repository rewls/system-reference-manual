= CRONTAB(5)

* File Formats Manual

== Name

* crontab - tables for driving cron

== Description

* A [.underline]#crontab# file contains instructions to the
  [.underline]#cron#(8) daemon of the general form: "run this command at this
  time on this date".
* Each user has their own crontab, and  commands in any given crontab will be
  executed as the user who owns the crontab.
* Uucp and News will usually have their own crontabs, eliminating the need for
  explicitly running [.underline]#su#(1) as part of a cron command.

'''

* Blank lines and leading spaces and tabs are ignored.
* Lines whose first non-space character is a pound-sign (#) are comments, and
  are ignored.
* Note that comments are not allowed on the same line as cron commands, since
  they will be taken to be part of the command.
* Similarly, comments are not allowed on the same line as environment variable
  settings.

'''

* An active line in a crontab will be either an environment setting or a cron
  command.
* An environment setting is of the form,
+
[source,crontab]
----
name = value
----
+
where the spaces around the equal-sign (=) are optional, and any subsequent
non-leading spaces in value will be part of the [.underline]#value# assigned to
[.underline]#name#.
* The [.underline]#value# string may be placed in quotes (single or double, but matching) to
  preserve leading or trailing blanks.

'''

* The format of a cron command is very much the V7 standard, with a number of
  upward-compatible extensions.
* Each line has five time and date fields, followed by a user name if this is
  the system crontab file, followed by a command.
* Commands are executed by [.underline]#cron#(8) when the minute, hour, and
  month of year fields match the current time, and when at least one of the
  two day fields (day of month, or day of week) match the current time (see
  "Note" below).
* [.underline]#cron#(8) examines cron entries once every minute.
* The time and date fields are:
+
|===
|field		|allowed values

|minute		|0-59
|hour		|0-23
|day of month	|0-31
|month		|0-12 (or names, see below)
|day of week	|0-7 (0 or 7 is Sun, or use names)
|===

* A field may be an asterisk (*), which always stands for "first-last".

'''

* Ranges of numbers are allowed.
* Ranges are two numbers separated with a hyphen.
* The specified range is inclusive.

'''

* Step values can be used in conjunction with ranges.
* Following a range with "/<number>" specifies skips of the number's value
  through the range.
* Steps are also permitted after an asterisk.

'''

* The "sixth" field (the rest of the line) specifies the command to be run.
* The entire command portion of the line, up to a newline or % character, will
  be executed by /bin/sh or by the shell specified in the SHELL variable of
  the cronfile.
* Percent-signs (%) in the command, unless escaped with backslash (\), will be
  changed into newline characters, and all data after the first % will be sent
  to the command as standard input.
