= PAM.CONF(5)

* Linux-PAM Manual

== Name

* pam.conf, pam.d - PAM configuration files

== Description

* When a PAM aware privilege granting application is started, it activates its
  attachment to the PAM-API.
* This activation performs a number of tasks, the most important being the
  reading of the configuration file(s): /etc/pam.conf.
* Alternatively, this may be the contents of the /etc/pam.d/ directory.
* The presence of this directory will cause Linux-PAM to ignore /etc/pam.conf.

'''

* These files list the PAMs that will do the authentication tasks required by
  this service, and the appropriate behavior of the PAM-API in the event that
  individual PAMs fail.

'''

* The syntax of the /etc/pam.conf configuration file is as follows.
* The file is made up of a list of rules, each rule is typically placed on a
  single line, but may be extended with an escaped end of line: '\<LF>'.
* Comments are preceded with '#' marks and extend to the next end of line.

'''

* The format of each rule is a space separated collection of tokens, the first
  three being case-insensitive:
+
[subs=quotes]
....
*service type control module-path module-arguments*
....


* The syntax of files contained in the /etc/pam.d/ directory, are identical
  except for the absence of any [.underline]#service# field.
* In this case, the [.underline]#service# is the name of the file in the
  /etc/pam.d/ directory.
* This filename must be in lower case.

'''

* An important feature of [.underline]#PAM#, is that a number of rules may be
  [.underline]#stacked# to combine the services of a number of PAMs for a
  given authentication task.

'''

* The [.underline]#service# is typically the familiar name of the
  corresponding application: [.underline]#login# and [.underline]#su# are good
  examples.
* The [.underline]#service#-name, [.underline]#other#, is reserved for giving
  default rules.
* Only lines that mention the current service (or in the absence of such, the
  [.underline]#other# entries) will be associated with the given service-application.

'''


* The [.underline]#type# is the management group that the rule corresponds to.
* It is used to specify which of the management groups the subsequent module
  is to be associated with.
* Valid entries are:

'''

password::
* this module type is required for updating the authentication token
  associated with the user.
* Typically, there is one module for each 'challenge/response' based
  authentication (auth) type.

'''

* The third field, [.underline]#control#, indicates the behavior of the
  PAM-API should the module fail to succeed in its authentication task.
* There are two types of syntax for this control field: the simple one has a
  single simple keyword; the more complicated one involves a square-bracketed
  selection of [.underline]#value=action# pairs.

'''

* For the simple (historical) syntax valid [.underline]#control# values are:

'''

required::
* failure of such a PAM will ultimately lead to the PAM-API returning failure
  but only after the remaining [.underline]#stacked# modules (for this
  [.underline]#service# and [.underline]#type#) have been invoked.

'''

* [.underline]#module-path# is either the full filename of the PAM to be used
  by the application (it begins with a '/'), or a relative pathname from the
  default module location: /lib/security/ or /lib64/security/, depending on
  the architecture.

'''

* [.underline]#module-arguments# are a space separated list of tokens that can
  be used to modify the specific behavior of the given PAM.
* Such arguments will be documented for each individual module.
* Note, if you wish to include spaces in an argument, you should surround that
  argument with square brackets.

'''

* Any line in (one of) the configuration file(s), that is not formatted
  correctly, will generally tend (erring on the side of caution) to make the
  authentication process fail.
* A corresponding error is written to the system log files with a call to
  *syslog*(3).

'''

* More flexible than the single configuration file is it to configure libpam
  via the contents of the /etc/pam.d/ directory.
* In this case the directory is filled with files each of which has a filename
  equal to a service-name (in lower-case): it is the personal configuration
  file for the named service.

'''

* The syntax of each file in /etc/pam.d/ is similar to that of the
  /etc/pam.conf file and is made up of lines of the following form:
+
....
type  control  module-path  module-arguments
....

* The only difference being that the service-name is not present.
* The service-name is of course the name of the given configuration file.
* For example, /etc/pam.d/login contains the configuration for the login
  service.
