....

== Description

* *free* displays the total amount of free and used physical and swap memory
  in the system, as well as the buffers and caches used by the kernel.
* The information is gathered by parsing /proc/meminfo.
* The displayed columns are:

'''

total::
* Total installed memory (MemTotal and SwapTotal in /proc/meminfo)

used::
* Used or unavailable memory (calculated as *total* - *available*)

free::
* Unused memory (MemFree and SwapFree in /proc/meminfo)

shared::
* Memory used (mostly) by tmpfs (Shmem in /proc/meminfo)

buffers::
* Memory used by kernel buffers (Buffers in /proc/meminfo)

cache::
* Memory used by the page cache and slabs (Cached and SReclaimable in
  /proc/meminfo)

buff/cache::
Sum of buffers and cache

available::
* Estimation of how much memory is available for starting new applications,
  without swapping.
* Unlike the data provided by the cache or free fields, this field takes into
  account page cache and also that not all reclaimable memory slabs will be
  reclaimed due to items being in use (MemAvailable in /proc/meminfo, available
  on kernels 3.14, emulated on kernels 2.6.27+, otherwise the same as
  *free*)

== Options

--mega::
* Display the amount of memory in megabytes.
* Implies *--si*.

--si::
* Use kilo, mega, giga etc (power of 1000) instead of kibi, mebi, gibi (power
  of 1024).
