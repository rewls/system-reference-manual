= LSCPU(1)

* User Commands

== Name

* lscpu - display information about the CPU architecture

== Synopsis

[subs="attributes,quotes+"]
....
*lscpu* {startsb}[.underline]##options##]
....

== Description

* *lscpu* gathers CPU architecture information from [.underline]#sysfs#,
  [.underline]#/proc/cpuinfo# and any applicable architecture-specific
  libraries (e.g. *librtas* on Powerpc).
* The command output can be optimized for parsing or for easy readability by
  humans.
* The information includes, for example, the number of CPUs, threads, cores,
  sockets, and Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) nodes.
* There is also information about the CPU caches and cache sharing, family,
  model, bogoMIPS, byte order, and stepping.

'''

* The default output formatting on terminal is subject to change and maybe
  optimized for better readability.
* The output for non-terminals (e.g., pipes) is never affected by this
  optimization and it is always in "Field: data\n" format.
* Use for example "*lscpu | less*" to see the default output without
  optimizations.

'''

* In virtualized environments, the CPU architecture information displayed
  reflects the configuration of the guest operating system which is typically
  different from the physical (host) system.
* On architectures that support retrieving physical topology information,
  *lscpu* also displays the number of physical sockets, chips, cores in the host
  system.

'''

* Options that result in an output table have a list argument.
* Use this argument to customize the command output.
* Specify a comma-separated list of column labels to limit the output table to
  only the specified columns, arranged in the specified order.
* See *COLUMNS* for a list of valid column labels. (?)
* The column labels are not case sensitive.

'''

* Not all columns are supported on all architectures. If an unsupported column
  is specified, *lscpu* prints the column but does not provide any data for it.

'''

* The cache sizes are reported as summary from all CPUs.
* The versions before v2.34 reported per-core sizes, but this output was
  confusing due to complicated CPUs topology and the way how caches are shared
  between CPUs.
* For more details about caches see *--cache*.
* Since version v2.37 *lscpu* follows cache IDs as provided by Linux kernel
  and it does not always start from zero.

== Options

`*-a*`, `*--all*`::
* Include lines for online and offline CPUs in the output (default for *-e*).
* This option may only be specified together with option *-e* or *-p*.

`*-b*`, `*--online*`::
* Limit the output to online CPUs (default for *-p*).
* This option may only be specified together with option *-e* or *-p*.

`*-C*`, `*--caches*{startsb}=[.underline]##list##]`::
* Display details about CPU caches.
* For details about available information see *--help* output.
+
'''

* If the [.underline]#list# argument is omitted, all columns for which data is available are
  included in the command output.
+
'''

* When specifying the [.underline]#list# argument, the string of option, equal sign (=), and
  [.underline]#list# must not contain any blanks or other whitespace.
* Examples: *-C=NAME,ONE-SIZE* or *--caches=NAME,ONE-SIZE*.
+
'''

* The default list of columns may be extended if list is specified in the
  format +list (e.g., *lscpu -C=+ALLOC-POLICY*).

`*-p*`, `*--parse*{startsb}=[.underline]#list#]`::
* Optimize the command output for easy parsing.
+
'''

* If the [.underline]#list# argument is omitted, the command output is compatible with
  earlier versions of *lscpu*.
* In this compatible format, two commas are used to separate CPU cache
  columns.
* If no CPU caches are identified the cache column is omitted.
* If the [.underline]#list# argument is used, cache columns are separated with
  a colon (:). (?)
+
'''

* When specifying the [.underline]#list# argument, the string of option, equal
  sign (=), and list must not contain any blanks or other whitespace.
* Examples: '*-p=cpu,node*' or '*--parse=cpu,node*'.
+
'''

* The default list of columns may be extended if list is specified in the
  format +list (e.g., lscpu -p=+MHZ).

`*--output-all*`::
* Output all available columns.
* This option must be combined with either *--extended*, *--parse* or
  *--caches*.

== Bugs

* The basic overview of CPU family, model, etc. is always based on the first
  CPU only.
