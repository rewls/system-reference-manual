= CRON(8)

* System Manager's Manual

== Name

* cron - daemon to execute scheduled commands (Vixie Cron)

== Description

* [.underline]#cron# is started automatically from /etc/init.d on entering
  multi-user runlevels.

== Notes

* [.underline]#cron# searches its spool area (/var/spool/cron/crontabs) for
  crontab files (which are named after accounts in /etc/passwd); crontabs
  found are loaded into memory.
* Note that crontabs in this directory should not be accessed directly - the
  [.underline]#crontab# command should be used to access and update them.

'''

* [.underline]#cron# also reads /etc/crontab, which is in a slightly different
  format (see [.underline]#crontab#(5)).
* In Debian, the content of /etc/crontab is predefined to run programs under
  /etc/cron.hourly, /etc/cron.daily, /etc/cron.weekly and /etc/cron.monthly.
* This configuration is specific to Debian, see the note under *DEBIAN
  SPECIFIC* below.

'''

* Additionally, in Debian, [.underline]#cron# reads the files in the
  /etc/cron.d directory.
* [.underline]#cron# treats the files in /etc/cron.d as in the same way as the
  /etc/crontab file (they follow the special format of that file, i.e. they
  include the user field).
* However, they are independent of /etc/crontab: they do not, for example,
  inherit environment variable settings from it.
* This change is specific to Debian see the note under *DEBIAN SPECIFIC* below.

'''

* Like /etc/crontab, the files in the /etc/cron.d directory are monitored for
  changes.
* In general, the system administrator should not use /etc/cron.d/, but use
  the standard system crontab /etc/crontab.

'''

* /etc/crontab and the files in /etc/cron.d must be owned by root, and must
  not be group- or other-writable.
* In contrast to the spool area, the files under /etc/cron.d or the files
  under /etc/cron.hourly, /etc/cron.daily, /etc/cron.weekly and
  /etc/cron.monthly  may  also  be  symlinks,  provided that both the symlink
  and the file it points to are owned by root.
* The files under /etc/cron.d do not need to be executable, while the files
  under /etc/cron.hourly, /etc/cron.daily, /etc/cron.weekly and
  /etc/cron.monthly do, as they are run by [.underline]#run-parts# (see
  [.underline]#run-parts#(8) for more information).

'''

* [.underline]#cron# then wakes up every minute, examining all stored
  crontabs, checking each command to see if it should be run in the current
  minute.
* When executing commands, any output is mailed to the owner of the crontab
  (or to the user named in the MAILTO environment variable in the crontab, if
  such exists) from the owner of the crontab (or from the email address given in
  the MAILFROM environment variable in the crontab, if such exists).
* The children copies of cron running these processes have their name coerced
  to uppercase, as will be seen in the syslog and ps output.

'''

* Additionally, [.underline]#cron# checks each minute to see if its spool
  directory's modtime (or the modtime on the [.underline]#/etc/crontab# file)
  has changed, and if it has, [.underline]#cron# will then examine the modtime
  on all crontabs and reload those which have changed.
* Thus [.underline]#cron# need not be restarted whenever a crontab file is
  modified.
* Note that the [.underline]#crontab#(1) command updates the modtime of the
  spool directory whenever it changes a crontab.

'''

* [.underline]#cron# logs its action to the syslog facility 'cron', and
  logging may be controlled using the standard [.underline]#syslogd#(8)
  facility.
