= RESOLVED.CONF(5)

= Name

* resolved.conf, resolved.conf.d - Network Name Resolution configuration files

== Synopsis

* /etc/systemd/resolved.conf
* /run/systemd/resolved.conf
* /usr/local/lib/systemd/resolved.conf
* /usr/lib/systemd/resolved.conf
* /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/*.conf
* /run/systemd/resolved.conf.d/*.conf
* /usr/local/lib/systemd/resolved.conf.d/*.conf
* /usr/lib/systemd/resolved.conf.d/*.conf

== Description

* These configuration files control local DNS and LLMNR name resolution.

== Configuration Directories And Precedence

* The default configuration is set during compilation, so configuration is only
  needed when it is necessary to deviate from those defaults.
* The main configuration file is loaded from one of the listed directories in
  order of priority, only the first file found is used: /etc/systemd/,
  /run/systemd/, /usr/local/lib/systemd/, /usr/lib/systemd/.
* The vendor version of the file contains commented out entries showing the
  defaults as a guide to the administrator.
* Local overrides can also be created by creating drop-ins, as described below.
* The main configuration file can also be edited for this purpose (or a copy in
  /etc/ if it's shipped under /usr/), however using drop-ins for local
  configuration is recommended over modifications to the main configuration file.

'''

* In addition to the main configuration file, drop-in configuration snippets are
  read from /usr/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/, /usr/local/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/, and
  /etc/systemd/*.conf.d/.
* Those drop-ins have higher precedence and override the main configuration
  file.
* Files in the *.conf.d/ configuration subdirectories are sorted by their
  filename in lexicographic order, regardless of in which of the subdirectories
  they reside.
* When multiple files specify the same option, for options which accept just a
  single value, the entry in the file sorted last takes precedence, and for
  options which accept a list of values, entries are collected as they occur in
  the sorted files.

'''

* When packages need to customize the configuration, they can install drop-ins
  under /usr/.
* Files in /etc/ are reserved for the local administrator, who may use this
  logic to override the configuration files installed by vendor packages.
* Drop-ins have to be used to override package drop-ins, since the main
  configuration file has lower precedence.
* It is recommended to prefix all filenames in those subdirectories with a
  two-digit number and a dash, to simplify the ordering.
* This also defines a concept of drop-in priorities to allow OS vendors to ship
  drop-ins within a specific range lower than the range used by users.
* This should lower the risk of package drop-ins overriding accidentally
  drop-ins defined by users.
* It is recommended to use the range 10-40 for drop-ins in /usr/ and the range
  60-90 for drop-ins in /etc/ and /run/, to make sure that local and transient
  drop-ins take priority over drop-ins shipped by the OS vendor.

'''

* To disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the recommended way is
  to place a symlink to /dev/null in the configuration directory in /etc/, with
  the same filename as the vendor configuration file.

== Options

* The following options are available in the [Resolve] section:
MulticastDNS=::
** Takes a boolean argument or "resolve".
** Controls Multicast DNS support (RFC 6762) on the local host.
** If true, enables full Multicast DNS responder and resolver support.
** If false, disables both.
** If set to "resolve", only resolution support is enabled, but responding is
   disabled.
** Note that *systemd-networkd.service*(8) also maintains per-link Multicast DNS
   settings.
** Multicast DNS will be enabled on a link only if the per-link and the global
   setting is on.
