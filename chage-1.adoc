= CHAGE(1)

* User Commands

== Name

* chage - change user password expiry information

== Synopsis

[subs="attributes,quotes+"]
....
*chage* {startsb}[.underline]#options#] [.underline]#LOGIN#
....

== Description

* The *chage* command changes the number of days between password changes and
  the date of the last password change.
* This information is used by the system to determine when a user must change
  their password.

'''

== Options

* The options which apply to the *chage* command are:

'''

`*-m*, *--mindays* [.underline]#MIN_DAYS#`::
* Set the minimum number of days between password changes to
  [.underline]#MIN_DAYS#.
* A value of zero for this field indicates that the user may change their
  password at any time.

`*-M*, *--maxdays* [.underline]#MAX_DAYS#`::
* Set the maximum number of days during which a password is valid.
* When [.underline]#MAX_DAYS# plus [.underline]#LAST_DAY# is less than the
  current day, the user will be required to change their password before being
  able to use their account.
* This occurrence can be planned for in advance by use of the *-W* option,
  which provides the user with advance warning.
+
'''
* Passing the number [.underlin]#-1# as [.underline]#MAX_DAYS# will remove
  checking a password's validity.

`*-W*, *--warndays* [.underline]#WARN_DAYS#`::
* Set the number of days of warning before a password change is required.
* The [.underline]#WARN_DAYS# option is the number of days prior to the
  password expiring that a user will be warned their password is about to
  expire.

'''

* If none of the options are selected, *chage* operates in an interactive
  fashion, prompting the user with the current values for all of the fields.
* Enter the new value to change the field, or leave the line blank to use the
  current value.
* The current value is displayed between a pair of [ ] marks.

== Note

* The *chage* program requires a shadow password file to be available.

'''

* The *chage* program will report only the information from the shadow
  password file.
* This implies that configuration from other sources (e.g. LDAP or empty
  password hash field from the passwd file) that affect the user's login will
  not be shown in the chage output.

'''

* The *chage* program will also not report any inconsistency between the
  shadow and passwd files (e.g. missing x in the passwd file).
* The *pwck* can be used to check for this kind of inconsistencies.

'''

* The chage command is restricted to the root user, except for the *-l*
  option, which may be used by an unprivileged user to determine when their
  password or account is due to expire.

== Files

/etc/passwd::
* User account information.

/etc/shadow::
* Secure user account information.
