== Name

* gawk -- pattern scanning and processing language

== Synopsis

`*gawk* [ POSIX or GNU style options ] -f [.underline]#program-file# [ -- ] file
\...`

`*gawk* [ POSIX or GNU style options ] [ -- ] [.underline]#program-text# file
\...`

== Description

* [.underline]#Gawk# is the GNU Project's implementation of the AWK programming
  language.
* This version in turn is based on the description in [.underline]#The AWK Programming
  Language#, by Aho, Kernighan, and Weinberger.
* [.underline]#Gawk# provides the additional features found in the current version of Brian
  Kernighan's [.underline]#awk# and numerous GNU-specific extensions.

'''

* The command line consists of options to [.underline]#gawk# itself, the AWK
  program text (if not supplied via the `*-f*` or `*--include*` options), and
  values to be made available in the `*ARGC*` and `*ARGV*` pre-defined AWK
  variables.

== Preface

* This manual page is intentionally as terse as possible.
* Full details are provided in [.underline]#GAWK: Effective AWK Programming#,
  and you should look there for the full story on any specific feature.
* Where possible, links to the online version of the manual are provided.

== AWK Program Execution

* An AWK program consists of a sequence of optional directives, pattern-action
  statements, and optional function definitions.
+
`**@include "**[.underline]#filename#**"**`
+
`**@load "**[.underline]#filename#**"**`
+
`**@namespace "**[.underline]#name#**"**`
+
`[.underline]#pattern# *{* [.underline]#action statements# *}*`
+
`*function* [.underline]#name#**(**[.underline]#parameter list#*)* *{*
[.underline]#statements# *}*`

* [.underline]#Gawk# first reads the program source from the
  [.underline]#program-file#(s) if specified, from arguments to
  `*--source*`, or from the first non-option argument on the command line.

* [.underline]#Gawk# executes AWK programs in the following order.
* Next, [.underline]#gawk# compiles the program into an internal form.

'''

* For each record in the input, [.underline]#gawk# tests to see if it matches
  any [.underline]#pattern# in the AWK program.
* For each pattern that the record matches, gawk executes the associated
  [.underline]#action#.
* The patterns are tested in the order they occur in the program.

== Variables, Records And Fields

* AWK variables are dynamic; they come into existence when they are first used.
* Their values are either floating-point numbers or strings, or both, depending upon how they are used.
* Additionally, gawk allows variables to have regular-expression type.
* AWK also has one dimensional arrays; arrays with multiple dimensions may be simulated.
* However, gawk provides true arrays of arrays.
* Several pre-defined variables are set as a program runs; these are described
  as needed and summarized below.

=== Records

* Normally, records are separated by newline characters.
* You can control how records are separated by assigning values to the built-in
  variable `*RS*`.

=== Fields

* As each input record is read, [.underline]#gawk# splits the record into
  [.underline]#fields#, using the value of the `*FS*` variable as the field separator.

'''

* Each field in the input record may be referenced by its position: `*$1*`,
  `*$2*`, and so on.
* `*$0*` is the whole record, including leading and trailing whitespace.

=== Built-in Variables

`*FS*`::
* The input field separator, a space by default.

=== Regexp Constants

* A regular expression constant is a sequence of characters enclosed between
  forward slashes (like `*/value/*`).

'''

* The escape sequences described in the manual may also be used inside constant
  regular expressions (e.g., `*/[ \t\f\n\r\v]/*` matches whitespace characters).

'''

* [.underline]#Gawk# provides [.underline]#strongly typed# regular expression
  constants.
* These are written with a leading *@* symbol (like so: `*@/value/*`).
* Such constants may be assigned to scalars (variables, array elements) and
  passed to user-defined functions.
* Variables that have been so assigned have regular expression type.

== Patterns And Actions

* AWK is line-oriented language.
* The pattern comes first, and then the action.
* Action statements are enclosed in `*{*` and `*}*`.
* Either the pattern may be missing, or the action may be missing.
* If the pattern is missing, the action executes for every single record of
  input.

'''

* Comments begin with the `*#*` character, and continue until the end of the
  line.
* Empty lines may be used to separate statements.
* Normally, a statement ends with a newline, however, this is not the case for
  lines ending in a comma, `*{*`, `*?*`, `*:*`, `*&&*`, or `*||*`.
* Lines ending in `*do*` or `*else*` also have their statements automatically
  continued on the following line.
* In other cases, a line can be continued by ending it with a "\", in which case
  the newline is ignored.
* However, a "\" after a `*#*` is not special.

'''

* Multiple statements may be put on one line by separating them with a "*;*". 
* This applies to both the statements within the action part of a pattern-action
  pair (the usual case), and to the pattern-action statements themselves.

=== Patterns

* AWK patterns may be one of the following:
+
`*/*[.underline]#regular expression#*/*`
+
`[.underline]#pattern# *&&* [.underline]#pattern#`
+
`[.underline]#pattern# *||* [.underline]#pattern#`
+
`*(*[.underline]#pattern#*)*`
+
`*!* [.underline]#pattern#`

* For `*/*[.underline]#regular expression#*/*` patterns, the associated
  statement is executed for each input record that matches the regular
  expression.
* Regular expressions are essentially the same as those in
  [.underline]#egrep#(1).

'''

* The `*&&*`, `*||*`, and `*!*` operators are logical AND, logical OR, and
  logical NOT, respectively, as in C.
* They do short-circuit evaluation, also as in C, and are used for combining
  more primitive pattern expressions.
* As in most languages, parentheses may be used to change the order of
  evaluation.

=== Actions

* Action statements are enclosed in braces, `*{*` and `*}*`.
* Action statements consist of the usual assignment, conditional, and looping
  statements found in most languages.
* The operators, control statements, and input/output statements available are patterned after those in C.

=== I/O Statements

* The input/output statements are as follows:

`*print*`::
** Print the current record.
