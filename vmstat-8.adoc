....
*vmstat* [options] {startsb}[.underline]#delay# {startsb}[.underline]#count#]]
....

== Description

* *vmstat* reports information about processes, memory, paging, block IO,
  traps, disks and cpu activity.

'''

* The first report produced gives averages since the last reboot.
* Additional reports give information on a sampling period of length delay.
* The process and memory reports are instantaneous in either case.

== Options

`[.underline]#delay#`::
* The delay between updates in seconds.
* If no delay is specified, only one report is printed with the average values
  since boot.

== Field description for vm mode

=== CPU

* These are percentages of total CPU time.
* us: Time spent running non-kernel code. +
  (user time, including nice time)
* sy: Time spent running kernel code. +
  (system time)
* id: Time spent idle. +
  Prior to Linux 2.5.41, this includes IO-wait time.
* wa: Time spent waiting for IO. +
  Prior to Linux 2.5.41, included in idle.
* st: Time stolen from a virtual machine. +
  Prior to Linux 2.6.11, unknown.
* gu: Time spent running KVM guest code (guest time, including guest nice).

== Notes

* *vmstat* does not require special permissions.

'''

* These reports are intended to help identify system bottlenecks.
* Linux *vmstat* does not count itself as a running process.

'''

* All linux blocks are currently 1024 bytes.
* Old kernels may report blocks as 512 bytes, 2048 bytes, or 4096 bytes.

'''

* Since procps 3.1.9, vmstat lets you choose units (k, K, m, M).
* Default is K (1024 bytes) in the default mode.

'''

* vmstat uses slabinfo 1.1
