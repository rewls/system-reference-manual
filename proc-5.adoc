* File Formats Manual

== Name

* proc - process information pseudo-filesystem

== Description

* The *proc* filesystem is a pseudo-filesystem which provides an interface to
  kernel data structures.
* It is commonly mounted at [.underline]#/proc#.
* Typically, it is mounted automatically by  the system, but it can also be
  mounted manually using a command such as:
+
[source,sh]
mount -t proc proc /proc

* Most of the files in the *proc* filesystem are read-only, but some files are
  writable, allowing kernel variables to be changed.

=== Overview

* Underneath [.underline]#/proc#, there are the following general groups of
  files and subdirectories:

'''

[.underline]##/proc/##pid subdirectories::
* Each one of these subdirectories contains files and subdirectories exposing
  information about the process with the corresponding process ID.
+
'''

* Underneath each of the [.underline]##/proc/##pid directories, a
  [.underline]#task# subdirectory contains subdirectories of the form
  [.underline]##task/##tid, which contain corresponding information about each
  of the threads in the process, where [.underline]#tid# is the kernel thread
  ID of the thread.
+
'''

* The [.underline]##/proc/##pid subdirectories are visible when iterating
  through [.underline]#/proc# with *getdents*(2) (and thus are visible when
  one uses *ls*(1) to view the contents of [.underline]#/proc#).

[.underline]##/proc/##tid subdirectories::
* Each one of these subdirectories contains files and subdirectories exposing
  information about the thread with the corresponding thread ID.
* The contents of these directories are the same as the corresponding
  [.underline]##/proc/##pid[.underline]##/task/##tid directories.
+
'''

* The [.underline]##/proc/##tid subdirectories are [.underline]#not# visible
  when iterating  through [.underline]#/proc#  with *getdents*(2) (and thus
  are not visible when one uses *ls*(1) to view the contents of
  [.underline]#/proc#).

[.underline]#/proc/[a-z]*#::
* Various other files and subdirectories under [.underline]#/proc# expose
  system-wide information.

'''

* All of the above are described in more detail below.


[.underline]#/proc/cpuinfo#::
* This is a collection of CPU and system architecture dependent items, for
  each supported architecture a different list.
* Two common entries are [.underline]#processor# which gives CPU number and
  [.underline]#bogomips#; a system constant that is calculated during kernel
  initialization.
* SMP machines have information for each CPU.
* The *lscpu*(1) command gathers its information from this file.

[.underline]#/proc/meminfo#::
* This file reports statistics about memory usage on the system.
* It is used by *free*(1) to report the amount of free and used memory (both
  physical and swap) on the system as well as the shared memory and buffers
  used by the kernel.
* Each line of the file consists of a parameter name, followed by a colon, the
  value of the parameter, and an option unit of measurement (e.g., "kB").
* The list below describes the parameter names and the format specifier
  required to read the field value.
* Except as noted below, all of the fields have been present since at least
  Linux 2.6.0.
* Some fields are displayed only if the kernel was configured with various
  options; those dependencies are noted in the list.
+
'''

[.underline]#MemTotal# %lu::
* Total usable RAM (i.e., physical RAM minus a few reserved bits and the
  kernel binary code).

[.underline]#MemFree# %lu::
* The sum of [.underline]##LowFree##+[.underline]##HighFree##.

[.underline]#MemAvailable# %lu (since Linux 3.14)::
* An estimate of how much memory is available for starting new applications,
  without swapping.

[.underline]#Buffers# %lu::
* Relatively temporary storage for raw disk blocks that shouldn't get
  tremendously large (20 MB or so).

[.underline]#Cached# %lu::
* In-memory cache for files read from the disk (the page cache).
* Doesn't include [.underline]#SwapCached#.

[.underline]#HighFree# %lu::
* (Starting with Linux 2.6.19, *CONFIG_HIGHMEM* is required.)
* Amount of free highmem.

[.underline]#LowFree# %lu::
* (Starting with Linux 2.6.19 *CONFIG_HIGHMEM* is required.)
* Amount of free lowmem.

[.underline]#SwapTotal# %lu::
* Total amount of swap space available.

[.underline]#SwapFree# %lu::
* Amount of swap space that is currently unused.

[.underline]#Shmem# %lu (since Linux 2.6.32):
* Amount of memory consumed in *tmpfs*(5) filesystems.

[.underline]#Slab# %lu::
* In-kernel data structures cache. (See *slabinfo*(5).)

[.underline]#SReclaimable# %lu (since Linux 2.6.19)::
* Part of [.underline]#Slab#, that might be reclaimed, such as caches.
