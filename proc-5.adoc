* File Formats Manual

== Name

* proc - process information pseudo-filesystem

== Description

* The *proc* filesystem is a pseudo-filesystem which provides an interface to
  kernel data structures.
* It is commonly mounted at [.underline]#/proc#.
* Typically, it is mounted automatically by  the system, but it can also be
  mounted manually using a command such as:
+
[source,sh]
mount -t proc proc /proc

* Most of the files in the *proc* filesystem are read-only, but some files are
  writable, allowing kernel variables to be changed.

=== Overview

* Underneath [.underline]#/proc#, there are the following general groups of
  files and subdirectories:

'''

[.underline]##/proc/##pid subdirectories::
* Each one of these subdirectories contains files and subdirectories exposing
  information about the process with the corresponding process ID.
+
'''

* Underneath each of the [.underline]##/proc/##pid directories, a
  [.underline]#task# subdirectory contains subdirectories of the form
  [.underline]##task/##tid, which contain corresponding information about each
  of the threads in the process, where [.underline]#tid# is the kernel thread
  ID of the thread.
+
'''

* The [.underline]##/proc/##pid subdirectories are visible when iterating
  through [.underline]#/proc# with *getdents*(2) (and thus are visible when
  one uses *ls*(1) to view the contents of [.underline]#/proc#).

[.underline]##/proc/##tid subdirectories::
* Each one of these subdirectories contains files and subdirectories exposing
  information about the thread with the corresponding thread ID.
* The contents of these directories are the same as the corresponding
  [.underline]##/proc/##pid[.underline]##/task/##tid directories.
+
'''

* The [.underline]##/proc/##tid subdirectories are [.underline]#not# visible
  when iterating  through [.underline]#/proc#  with *getdents*(2) (and thus
  are not visible when one uses *ls*(1) to view the contents of
  [.underline]#/proc#).

[.underline]#/proc/[a-z]*#::
* Various other files and subdirectories under [.underline]#/proc# expose
  system-wide information.

'''

* All of the above are described in more detail below.

==== [.underline]#/proc/cpuinfo#

* This is a collection of CPU and system architecture dependent items, for
  each supported architecture a different list.
* Two common entries are [.underline]#processor# which gives CPU number and
  [.underline]#bogomips#; a system constant that is calculated during kernel
  initialization.
* SMP machines have information for each CPU.
* The *lscpu*(1) command gathers its information from this file.

==== [.underline]#/proc/meminfo#

* This file reports statistics about memory usage on the system.
* It is used by *free*(1) to report the amount of free and used memory (both
  physical and swap) on the system as well as the shared memory and buffers
  used by the kernel.
* Each line of the file consists of a parameter name, followed by a colon, the
  value of the parameter, and an option unit of measurement (e.g., "kB").
* The list below describes the parameter names and the format specifier
  required to read the field value.
* Except as noted below, all of the fields have been present since at least
  Linux 2.6.0.
* Some fields are displayed only if the kernel was configured with various
  options; those dependencies are noted in the list.

'''

[.underline]#MemTotal# %lu::
* Total usable RAM (i.e., physical RAM minus a few reserved bits and the
  kernel binary code).

[.underline]#MemFree# %lu::
* The sum of [.underline]##LowFree##+[.underline]##HighFree##.

[.underline]#MemAvailable# %lu (since Linux 3.14)::
* An estimate of how much memory is available for starting new applications,
  without swapping.

[.underline]#Buffers# %lu::
* Relatively temporary storage for raw disk blocks that shouldn't get
  tremendously large (20 MB or so).

[.underline]#Cached# %lu::
* In-memory cache for files read from the disk (the page cache).
* Doesn't include [.underline]#SwapCached#.

[.underline]#HighFree# %lu::
* (Starting with Linux 2.6.19, *CONFIG_HIGHMEM* is required.)
* Amount of free highmem.

[.underline]#LowFree# %lu::
* (Starting with Linux 2.6.19 *CONFIG_HIGHMEM* is required.)
* Amount of free lowmem.

[.underline]#SwapTotal# %lu::
* Total amount of swap space available.

[.underline]#SwapFree# %lu::
* Amount of swap space that is currently unused.

[.underline]#Shmem# %lu (since Linux 2.6.32):
* Amount of memory consumed in *tmpfs*(5) filesystems.

[.underline]#Slab# %lu::
* In-kernel data structures cache. (See *slabinfo*(5).)

[.underline]#SReclaimable# %lu (since Linux 2.6.19)::
* Part of [.underline]#Slab#, that might be reclaimed, such as caches.

==== [.underline]#/proc/stat#

* kernel/system statistics.
* Varies with architecture.
* Common entries include:
              cpu 10132153 290696 3084719 46828483 16683 0 25195 0 175628 0
              cpu0 1393280 32966 572056 13343292 6130 0 17875 0 23933 0

* The amount of time, measured in units of USER_HZ (1/100ths of a second on
  most architectures, use [.underline]#sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)# to obtain the
  right value), that the system ("cpu" line) or the specific CPU
  ("cpu[.underline]##N##" line) spent in various states:

'''

[.underline]#user#::
* (1) Time spent in user mode.

[.underline]#nice#::
* (2) Time spent in user mode with low priority (nice).

[.underline]#system#::
* (3) Time spent in system mode.

[.underline]#idle#::
* (4) Time spent in the idle task.
* This value should be USER_HZ times the second entry in the
  [.underline]#/proc/uptime# pseudo-file.

[.underline]#iowait# (since Linux 2.5.41)::
* (5) Time waiting for I/O to complete.
* This value is not reliable, for the following reasons:
** The CPU will not wait for I/O to complete; iowait is the time that a task
   is waiting for I/O to complete. +
   When a CPU goes into idle state for outstanding task I/O, another task will
   be scheduled on this CPU.
** On a multi-core CPU, the task waiting for I/O to complete is not running on
   any CPU, so the iowait of each CPU is difficult to calculate.
** The value in this field may [.underline]#decrease# in certain conditions.

[.underline]#steal# (since Linux 2.6.11)::
* (8) Stolen time, which is the time spent in other operating systems when
  running in a virtualized environment

[.underline]#guest# (since Linux 2.6.24)::
* (9) Time spent running a virtual CPU for guest operating systems under the
  control of the Linux kernel.

[.underline]#guest_nice# (since Linux 2.6.33)::
* (10) Time spent running a niced guest (virtual CPU for guest operating
  systems under the control of the Linux kernel).

== Notes

* This manual page is incomplete, possibly inaccurate, and is the kind of
  thing that needs to be updated very often.
