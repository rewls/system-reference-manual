= LOGIN.DEFS(5)

== Name

* login.defs - shadow password suite configuration

== Description

* The /etc/login.defs file defines the site-specific configuration for the
  shadow password suite.
* This file is required.
* Absence of this file will not prevent system operation, but will probably
  result in undesirable operation.

'''

* This file is a readable text file, each line of the file describing one
  configuration parameter.
* The lines consist of a configuration name and value, separated by
  whitespace.
* Blank lines and comment lines are ignored.
* Comments are introduced with a "#" pound sign and the pound sign must be the
  first non-white character of the line.

'''

* Parameter values may be of four types: strings, booleans, numbers, and long
  numbers.
* A string is comprised of any printable characters.
* A boolean should be either the value [.underline]#yes# or
  [.underline]#no#.
* An undefined boolean parameter or one with a value other than these will be
  given a no value.
* Numbers (both regular and long) may be either decimal values, octal values
  (precede the value with 0) or hexadecimal values (precede the value with
0x).
* The maximum value of the regular and long numeric parameters is
  machine-dependent.

'''

* The following configuration items are provided:
LOGIN_RETRIES (number)::
* Maximum number of login retries in case of bad password.
+
'''

* This will most likely be overridden by PAM, since the default pam_unix
  module has its own built in of 3 retries.
* However, this is a safe fallback in case you are using an authentication
  module that does not enforce PAM_MAXTRIES.

PASS_MAX_DAYS (number)::
* The maximum number of days a password may be used.
* If the password is older than this, a password change will be forced.
* If not specified, -1 will be assumed (which disables the restriction).

PASS_MIN_DAYS (number)::
* The minimum number of days allowed between password changes.
* Any password changes attempted sooner than this will be rejected.
* If not specified, 0 will be assumed (which disables the restriction).

PASS_WARN_AGE (number)::
* The number of days warning given before a password expires.
* A zero means warning is given only upon the day of expiration, a negative
  value means no warning is given.
* If not specified, no warning will be provided.

'''

* *PASS_MAX_DAYS*, *PASS_MIN_DAYS* and *PASS_WARN_AGE* are only used at the
  time of account creation.
* Any changes to these settings won't affect existing accounts.
