= DF(1)

* User Commands

== Name

* df - report file system space usage

== Synopsis

[subs="attributes,quotes+"]
....
*df* {startsb}[.underline]#OPTION#]... {startsb}[.underline]#FILE#]...
....

== Description

* This manual page documents the GNU version of *df*.
* *df* displays the amount of space available on the file system containing
  each file name argument.
* If no file name is given, the space available  on all currently mounted file
  systems is shown.
* Space is shown in 1K blocks by default, unless the environment variable
  POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, in which case 512-byte  blocks are used.

'''

* If an argument is the absolute file name of a device node containing a
  mounted file system, *df* shows the space available on that file system rather than on the file system containing the device node.
* This version of *df* cannot show the space available on unmounted file
  systems, because on most kinds of systems doing so requires very nonportable
  intimate knowledge of file system structures.

== OPTIONS

* Show information about the file system on which each FILE resides, or all
  file systems by default.

'''

* Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

'''

*--total*::
* elide all entries insignificant to available space, and produce a grand
  total
