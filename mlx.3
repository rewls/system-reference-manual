.SH NAME

MiniLibX - Simple X-Window Interface Library for students

.SH SYNOPSYS

#include <mlx.h>

.nf
.I void *
.fi
.B mlx_init
();

.SH DESCRIPTION

.IP \[bu] 3
MiniLibX is an easy way to create graphical software,
without any X-Window programming knowledge.
.IP \[bu]
It provides
simple window creation, a drawing tool, image and basic events
management.

.SH X-WINDOW CONCEPT

.IP \[bu] 3
X-Window is a network-oriented graphical system for Unix.
.IP \[bu]
It is based on two main parts:
.RS
.IP \[bu] 3
On one side, your software wants to draw something on the screen and/or
get keyboard & mouse entries.
.IP \[bu] 3
On the other side, the X-Server manages the screen, keyboard and mouse
(It is often referred to as a "display").
.RE
.IP \[bu]
A network connection must be established between these two entities to send
drawing orders (from the software to the X-Server), and keyboard/mouse
events (from the X-Server to the software).

.SH INCLUDE FILE

.IP \[bu] 3
.B mlx.h
should be included for a correct use of the MiniLibX API.
.IP \[bu]
It only contains function prototypes, no structure is needed.

.SH LIBRARY FUNCTIONS

.IP \[bu] 3
First of all, you need to initialize the connection
between your software and the display.
.IP \[bu]
Once this connection is established, you'll be able to
use other MiniLibX functions to send the X-Server messages,
like "I want to draw a yellow pixel in this window" or "did the
user hit a key?".
.P
-
.IP \[bu] 3
The
.B mlx_init
function will create this connection.
.IP \[bu]
No parameters are needed, and it will
return a
.I "void *"
identifier, used for further calls to the library routines.
.P

.IP \[bu]
All other MiniLibX functions are described in the following man pages:

.TP 20
.B mlx_new_window
: manage windows
.TP 20
.B mlx_pixel_put
: draw inside window
.TP 20
.B mlx_new_image
: manipulate images
.TP 20
.B mlx_loop
: handle keyboard or mouse events

.SH LINKING MiniLibX

.IP \[bu] 3
To use MiniLibX functions, you'll need to link
your software with several libraries, including the MiniLibX library itself.
.IP \[bu]
To do this, simply add the following arguments at linking time:
.B -lmlx -lXext -lX11
.IP \[bu]
You may also need to specify the path to these libraries, using
the
.B -L
flag.

.SH RETURN VALUES

.IP \[bu]
If
.B mlx_init()
fails to set up the connection to the X server, it will return NULL, otherwise
a non-null pointer is returned as a connection identifier.
