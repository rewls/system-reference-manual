= SSHD_CONFIG(5)

== Name

* *sshd_config* -- OpenSSH daemon configuration file

== Description

* sshd(8) reads configuration data from [.underline]#/etc/ssh/sshd_config# (or
  the file specified with *-f* on the command line).
* The file contains keyword-argument pairs, one per line.
* For each keyword, the first obtained value will be used.
* Lines starting with '#' and empty lines are interpreted as comments.
* Arguments may optionally be enclosed in double quotes (") in order to
  represent arguments containing spaces.

'''

* The possible keywords and their meanings are as follows (note that keywords
  are case-insensitive and arguments are case-sensitive):

'''

Port::
* Specifies the port number that sshd(8) listens on.
* The default is 22.
* Multiple options of this type are permitted.
* See also *ListenAddress*.

PermitRootLogin::
* Specifies whether root can log in using ssh(1).
* The argument must be *yes*, *prohibit-password*, *forced-commands-only*, or
  *no*.
* The default is *prohibit-password*.
+
'''

* If this option is set to *prohibit-password* (or its deprecated alias,
  *without-password*), password and keyboard-interactive authentication are
  disabled for root.
+
'''

* If this option is set to *forced-commands-only*, root login with public key
  authentication will be allowed, but only if the command option has been
  specified (which may be useful for taking remote backups even if root login
  is normally not allowed).
* All other authentication methods are disabled for root.
+
'''

* If this option is set to *no*, root is not allowed to log in.
