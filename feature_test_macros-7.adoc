= FEATURE_TEST_MACROS(7)

== Name

* feature_test_macros - feature test macros

== Description

* Feature test macros allow the programmer to control the definitions that are
  exposed by system header files when a program is compiled.

[NOTE]
====
* In order to be effective, a feature test macro [.underline]#must be defined
  before including any header files#.
* This can be done either in the compilation command ([.underline]#cc
  -DMACRO=value#) or by defining the macro within the source code before
  including any headers.
* The requirement that the macro must be defined before including any header
  file exists because header files may freely include one another.
* Thus, for example, in the following  lines, defining the *_GNU_SOURCE* macro
  may have no effect because the header [.underline]#<abc.h># itself includes
  [.underline]#<xyz.h># (POSIX explicitly allows this):
+
[source,c]
#include <abc.h>
#define _GNU_SOURCE
#include <xyz.h>

====

* Some feature test macros are useful for creating portable applications, by
  preventing nonstandard definitions from being exposed.
* Other macros can be used to expose nonstandard definitions that are not
  exposed by default.

'''

* The precise effects of each of the feature test macros described below can
  be ascertained by inspecting the [.underline]#<features.h># header file.

[NOTE]
====
* applications do [.underline]#not# need to directly include
  [.underline]#<features.h>#; indeed, doing so is actively discouraged.
* See NOTES.

=== Default definitions, implicit definitions, and combining definitions

* If no feature test macros are explicitly defined, then the following feature
  test macros are defined by default: *_BSD_SOURCE* (in glibc 2.19 and
  earlier), *_SVID_SOURCE* (in glibc 2.19 and earlier), *_DEFAULT_SOURCE* (since
  glibc 2.19), *_POSIX_SOURCE*, and *_POSIX_C_SOURCE*=200809L (200112L in glibc
  versions before 2.10; 199506L in glibc versions before 2.4; 199309L in glibc
  versions before 2.1).
