= LSBLK(8)

* System Administration

== Name

* lsblk - list block devices

* Synopsis

[subs="attributes,quotes+"]
....
*lsblk* [options] {startsb}[.underline]##device##...]
....

== Description

* *lsblk* lists information about all available or the specified block
  devices.
* The *lsblk* command reads the *sysfs* filesystem and *udev db* to gather information.
* If the udev db is not available or *lsblk* is compiled without udev support,
  then it tries to read LABELs, UUIDs and filesystem types from the block
  device.
* In this case root permissions are necessary.

'''

* The command prints all block devices (except RAM disks) in a tree-like
  format by default.
* Use *lsblk --help* to get a list of all available columns.

'''

* The default output, as well as the default output from options like *--fs*
  and *--topology*, is subject to change.
* So whenever possible, you should avoid using default outputs in your
  scripts.
* Always explicitly define expected columns by using *--output*
  [.underline]#columns-list# and *--list* in environments where a stable
  output is required.

'''

* Note that *lsblk* might be executed in time when *udev* does not have all
  information about recently added or modified devices yet.
* In this case it is recommended to use *udevadm settle* before *lsblk* to
  synchronize with udev.

'''

* The relationship between block devices and filesystems is not always
  one-to-one.
* The filesystem may use more block devices, or the same filesystem may be
  accessible by more paths.
* This is the reason why *lsblk* provides MOUNTPOINT and MOUNTPOINTS (pl.)
  columns.
* The column MOUNTPOINT displays only one mount point (usually the last
  mounted instance of the filesystem), and the column MOUNTPOINTS displays by
  multi-line cell all mount points associated with the device.

== Options

`*-n*`, `*--noheadings*`::
* Do not print a header line.

`*-o*, `*--output* [.underline]#list#`::
* Specify which output columns to print.
* Use *--help* to get a list of all supported columns.
* The columns may affect tree-like output.
* The default is to use tree for the column 'NAME' (see also *--tree*).
+
'''

* The default list of columns may be extended if [.underline]#list# is
  specified in the format [.underline]+list# (e.g., *lsblk -o +UUID*).


== Notes

* For partitions, some information (e.g., queue attributes) is inherited from the parent device.

'''

* The *lsblk* command needs to be able to look up each block device by
  major:minor numbers, which is done by using [.underline]#/sys/dev/block#.
* This sysfs block directory appeared in kernel 2.6.27 (October 2008).
* In case of problems with a new enough kernel, check that *CONFIG_SYSFS* was
  enabled at the time of the kernel build.
