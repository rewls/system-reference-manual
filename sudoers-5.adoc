= SUDOERS(5)

* BSD File Formats Manual

== Name

* sudoers -- default sudo security policy plugin

== Description

* The *sudoers* policy plugin determines a user's *sudo* privileges.
* It is the default *sudo* policy plugin.
* The policy is driven by the [.underline]#/etc/sudoers# file or, optionally,
  in LDAP.
* The policy format is described in detail in the SUDOERS FILE FORMAT section.
* For information on storing *sudoers* policy information in LDAP, see
  sudoers.ldap(5).

=== Logging

* By default, *sudoers* logs both successful and unsuccessful attempts (as
  well as errors).
* Messages can be logged to syslog(3), a log file, or both.
* The default is to log to syslog(3) but this is configurable via the
  [.underline]#syslog# and [.underline]#logfile# settings.

'''

* *sudoers* is also capable of running a command in a pseudo-terminal and
  logging input and/or output.
* The standard input, standard output, and standard error can be logged even
  when not associated with a terminal.
* For more information about I/O logging, see the [.underline]#I/O LOGGING#
  section.

=== Command environment

* Since environment variables can influence program behavior, *sudoers* provides
  a means to restrict which variables from the user's environment are
  inherited by the command to be run.
* There are two distinct ways *sudoers* can deal with environment variables.

'''

* By default, the [.underline]#env_reset# flag is enabled.
* This causes commands to be executed with a new, minimal environment.
* The HOME, MAIL, SHELL, LOGNAME and USER environment variables are
  initialized based on the target user and the SUDO_* variables are set based
on the invoking user.
* Additional variables, such as DISPLAY, PATH and TERM, are preserved from the
  invoking user's environment if permitted by the [.underline]#env_check#, or
  [.underline]#env_keep# options.
* A few environment variables are treated specially.
* If the PATH and TERM variables are not preserved from the user's
  environment, they will be set to default values.

== Sudoers file format

* The [.underline]#sudoers# file is composed of two types of entries: aliases
  (basically variables) and user specifications (which specify who may run
  what).

'''

* When multiple entries match for a user, they are applied in order.
* Where there are multiple matches, the last match is used (which is not
  necessarily the most specific match).

'''

* The [.underline]#sudoers# file grammar will be described below in Extended
  Backus-Naur Form (EBNF).
* Don't despair if you are unfamiliar with EBNF; it is fairly simple, and the
  definitions below are annotated.

=== Quick guide to EBNF

* EBNF is a concise and exact way of describing the grammar of a language.
* Each EBNF definition is made up of [.underline]#production rules#.
* For example:
+
....
symbol ::= definition | alternate1 | alternate2 ...
....

* Each [.underline]#production rule# references others and thus makes up a
  grammar for the language.
* EBNF also contains the following operators, which many readers will
  recognize from regular expressions.
* Do not, however, confuse them with "wildcard" characters, which have
  different meanings.

'''
?::
* Means that the preceding symbol (or group of symbols) is optional.
* That is, it may appear once or not at all.

*::
* Means that the preceding symbol (or group of symbols) may appear zero or
  more times.

+::
* Means that the preceding symbol (or group of symbols) may appear one or more
  times.

* Parentheses may be used to group symbols together.
* For clarity, we will use single quotes ('') to designate what is a verbatim
  character string (as opposed to a symbol name).

=== Aliases

* There are four kinds of aliases: [.underline]#User_Alias#,
  [.underline]#Runas_Alias#, [.underline]#Host_Alias# and
  [.underline]#Cmnd_Alias#.
* Beginning with sudo 1.9.0, [.underline]#Cmd_Alias# may be used in place of
  [.underline]#Cmnd_Alias# if desired.

[source,ebnf]
----
Alias ::= 'User_Alias' User_Alias_Spec

User_Alias ::= NAME

User_Alias_Spec ::= User_Alias '=' User_List

NAME ::= [A-Z]([A-Z][0-9]_)*
----

'''

* Each [.underline]#alias# definition is of the form
+
[source,ebnf]
Alias_Type NAME = item1, item2, ...
+
where [.underline]#Alias_Type# is one of [.underline]#User_Alias#,
[.underline]#Runas_Alias#, [.underline]#Host_Alias#, or
[.underline]#Cmnd_Alias#.
* A NAME is a string of uppercase letters, numbers, and underscore characters
  ('_').
* A NAME must start with an uppercase letter.
* It is possible to put several alias definitions of the same type on a single line, joined by a colon (':').
* For example:
+
[source,ebnf]
Alias_Type NAME = item1, item2, item3 : NAME = item4, item5

* It is a syntax error to redefine an existing alias.
* It is possible to use the same name for aliases of different types, but this
  is not recommended.

'''

* The definitions of what constitutes a valid alias member follow.

[source,ebnf]
----
User_List ::= User

User ::= '!'* user name |
	 '!'* %group |
----

[source,ebnf]
----
Runas_List ::= Runas_Member

Runas_Member ::= '!'* ALL
----

[source,ebnf]
----
Host_List ::= Host

Host ::= '!'* ALL
----

[source,ebnf]
----
command ::= ALL

Cmnd ::= command
----

=== Defaults

* Certain configuration options may be changed from their default values at
  run-time via one or more [.underline]#Default_Entry# lines.
* These may affect all users on any host, all users on a specific host, a
  specific user, a specific command, or commands being run as a specific user.

[source,ebnf]
----
Default_Type ::= 'Defaults' |
		 'Defaults' '@' Host_List

Default_Entry ::= Default_Type Parameter_List

Parameter_List ::= Parameter |
		   Parameter ',' Parameter_List

Parameter ::= Parameter '=' Value
----

* Parameters may be *flags*, *integer* values, *strings*, or *lists*.
* Flags are implicitly boolean and can be turned off via the '!' operator.
* Some integer, string and list parameters may also be used in a boolean
  context to disable them.
* Values may be enclosed in double quotes ("") when they contain multiple
  words.
* Special characters may be escaped with a backslash ('\').

'''

* See [.underline]#SUDOERS OPTIONS# for a list of supported Defaults
  parameters.

=== User specification

[source,ebnf]
----
User_Spec ::= User_List Host_List '=' Cmnd_Spec_List

Cmnd_Spec_List ::= Cmnd_Spec

Cmnd_Spec ::= Runas_Spec? Cmnd

Runas_Spec ::= '(' Runas_List? (':' Runas_List)? ')'
----

* A *user specification* determines which commands a user may run (and as what
  user) on specified hosts.
* By default, commands are run as *root* (unless [.underline]#runas_default#
  has been set to a different value) but this can also be changed on a
  per-command basis.

=== Runas_Spec

* A [.underlin]#Runas_Spec# determines the user and/or the group that a command may be run as.
* A fully-specified [.underline]#Runas_Spec# consists of two
  [.underline]#Runas_Lists# (as defined above) separated by a colon (':') and
  enclosed in a set of parentheses.
* The first [.underline]#Runas_List# indicates which users the command may be
  run as via the *-u* option.
* The second defines a list of groups that may be specified via the *-g*
  option (in addition to any of the target user's groups).
* If both [.underline]#Runas_Lists# are specified, the command may be run with
  any combination of users and groups listed in their respective
  [.underline]#Runas_Lists#.

=== Other special characters and reserved words

* White space between elements in a list as well as special syntactic
  characters in a User Specification ('=', ':', '(', ')') is optional.

== Sudoers options

* *sudo*'s behavior can be modified by [.underline]#Default_Entry# lines, as
  explained earlier.
* A list of all supported Defaults parameters, grouped by type, are listed
  below.

=== Boolean Flags:

env_editor::
* If set, *visudo* will use the value of the SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL or EDITOR
  environment variables before falling back on the default editor list.
* *visudo* is typically run as root so this flag may allow a user with
  *visudo* privileges to run arbitrary commands as root without logging.
* If the [.underline]#env_reset# flag is enabled, the SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL
  and/or EDITOR environment variables must be present in the
  [.underline]#env_keep# list for the [.underline]#env_editor# flag to
  function when *visudo* is invoked via *sudo*.
* This flag is [.underlin]#on# by default.

env_reset::
* If set, *sudo* will run the command in a minimal environment containing the
  TERM, PATH, HOME, MAIL, SHELL, LOGNAME, USER and SUDO_* variables.
* If the [.underline]#secure_path# setting is enabled, its value will be used for the PATH environment variable.
* This flag is [.underline]#on# by default.

log_input::
* If set, *sudo* will run the command in a pseudo-terminal (if *sudo* was run
  from a terminal) and log all user input.
* If the standard input is not connected to the user's terminal, due to I/O
  redirection or because the command is part of a pipeline, that input is also
logged.
* For more information about I/O logging, see the [.underline]#I/O LOGGING# section.
* This flag is [.underline]#off# by default.

log_output::
* If set, *sudo* will run the command in a pseudo-terminal (if *sudo* was run
  from a terminal) and log all output that is sent to the user's terminal, the
  standard output or the standard error.
* If the standard output or standard error is not connected to the user's terminal, due to I/O redirection or because the command is part of a pipeline, that output is also logged.
*  For more information about I/O logging, see the [.underline]#I/O logging# section.
* This flag is [.underline]#off# by default.

pam_acct_mgmt::
* On systems that use PAM for authentication, *sudo* will perform PAM account
  validation for the invoking user by default.
* The actual checks performed depend on which PAM modules are configured.
* If enabled, account validation will be performed regardless of whether or
  not a password is required.
* This flag is [.underline]#on# by default.
+
'''

* This setting is only supported by version 1.8.28 or higher.

requiretty::
* If set, *sudo* will only run when the user is logged in to a real tty.
* When this flag is set, *sudo* can only be run from a login session and not
  via other means such as *cron*(8) or *cgi-bin* scripts.
* This flag is [.underline]#off# by default.

=== Strings:

badpass_message::
* Message that is displayed if a user enters an incorrect password.
* The default is "Sorry, try again." unless insults are enabled.

iolog_dir::
* The top-level directory to use when constructing the path name for the
  input/output log directory.
* Only used if the [.underlin]#log_input# or [.underlin]#log_output# options
  are enabled or when the LOG_INPUT or LOG_OUTPUT tags are present for a
  command.
* The session sequence number, if any, is stored in the directory.
* The default is [.underline]#/var/log/sudo-io#.

=== Strings that can be used in a boolean context:

logfile::
* Path to the *sudo* log file (not the syslog log file).
* Setting a path turns on logging to a file; negating this option turns it
  off.
* By default, *sudo* logs via syslog.
+
'''

* *sudoers* is also capable of running a command in a pseudo-terminal and
  logging input and/or output.
* The standard input, standard output, and standard error can be logged even
  when not associated with a terminal.
* For more information about I/O logging, see the [.underline]#I/O LOGGING# section.

secure_path::
* If set, *sudo* will use this value in place of the user's PATH environment
  variable.
* This option can be used to reset the PATH to a known good value that
  contains directories for system administrator commands such as
  [.underline]#/usr/sbin#.
+
'''

* This option is not set by default.

== I/O logging

* When I/O logging is enabled, *sudo* will runs the command in a
  pseudo-terminal, logging user input and/or output, depending on which
  *sudoers* flags are enabled.
* There are five distinct types of I/O that can be logged, each with a
  corresponding *sudoers* flag.

[%autowidth]
|===
|Type		|Flag		|Description

|terminal input	|log_ttyin	|keystrokes entered by the user
|terminal output|log_ttyout	|command output displayed to the screen
|standard input	|log_stdin	|input from a pipe or a file
|standard output|log_stdout	|output to a pipe or a file
|standard error	|log_stderr	|output to a pipe or a file
|===

* In addition to flags described the above, the [.underline]#log_input# flag
  and LOG_INPUT command tag set both [.underline]#log_ttyin# and
  [.underline]#log_stdin#.
* The [.underline]#log_output# flag and LOG_OUTPUT command tag set
  [.underline]#log_ttyout#,
  [.underline]#log_stdout#, and [.underline]#log_stderr#.

'''

* To capture terminal input and output, *sudo* run the command in a
  pseudo-terminal, logging the input and output before passing it on to the
  user.
* To capture the standard input, standard output or standard error,
  *sudo* uses a pipe to interpose itself between the input or output stream,
  logging the I/O before passing it to the other end of the pipe.

'''

* I/O can be logged either to the local machine or to a remote log server.
* For local logs, I/O is logged to the directory specified by the
  [.underline]#iolog_dir# option ([.underline]#/var/log/sudo-io] by default)
  using a unique session ID that is included in the *sudo* log line, prefixed with 'TSID='.
* The [.underline]#iolog_file# option may be used to control the format of the
  session ID.

=== I/O log format

* All files other than [.underline]#log# are compressed in gzip format unless the
  [.underline]#compress_io# flag has been disabled.
* Due to buffering, it is not normally possible to display the I/O logs in
  real-time as the program is executing.
* The I/O log data will not be complete until the program run by *sudo* has
  exited or has been terminated by a signal.
* The [.underline]#iolog_flush# flag can be used to disable buffering, in
  which case I/O log data is written to disk as soon as it is available.
* The output portion of an I/O log file can be viewed with the *sudoreplay*(8)
  utility, which can also be used to list or search the available logs.
